Its Architectural Design Pattern.
Here Publisher need to subcribe with the subscriber in order to get the updates when the state or value of the subscriber changes.
Here good example is Quaro Feed.For example someone posted a question on Quaro and there are people who are interested in knowing the answer to the 
question if someone posts an answer.Then those people go and click on follow button.As sson as someone posts an answer there,quora notifies all
the followers.
